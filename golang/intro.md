# History

# Why Go? 

- Most languages could not take advantage of existing infrastructure.
    - Scalable & distributed
    - Dynamic
    - Has more capacity
- Parallel programming.
- Multithreading. (Do multiple things at once)
- Multi-core concurrency. (Dealing with lots of things at once)
    - Prevent conflicts between tasks running in parallel (while accessing shared data).

## Main Use Cases

- Writing applications that need to be performant.
- Running on scaled, distributed systems.

# Characteristics of Go

- Simple syntax.
- Fast build time, start up and run.
- Requires fewer resources.
- Compiles into a single binary that is consistent across platforms.
