# Tags
- Tags are used to describe some specific information about a name field.

## Sample

### Format

- Backticks (``) are the delimiters of a tag.
- There are space delimiters key-value pairs.
- A colon (`:`) is used to separate the key and the values.
- The values are typically in quotation marks ("")

### Code
- GOAL: The ingredient field must be required and have a minimum of 3 items.

```go
type food struct {
    ingredients []string `required min:"3"`
    origin string
}
```

## How To Access Tags

Tags are accessed using Go's `reflect` package.

## Steps

> Using the `food` struct defined above.

1. Get the type of the object.

```go
t := reflect.TypeOf(food{})
```

2. Grab the field from the data type with the tag.

```go
field, _ := t.FieldByName("ingredients")
```
3. Get the tag property from the field.

```go
tag := field.Tag
```
