# The Basics

- A computerâ€™s main memory is divided into numbered units called bytes.

## Java ByteCode

- The Java compiler translates your java program into a language called a **bytecode**.
- The bytecode is a machine language for the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
- The JVM translates and runs the java bytecode.
- Modern implementation of the JVM uses a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler.
